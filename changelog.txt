    - Quality now automatically inferred from source platform
    - Starter pack type inferred from source platform
  Improvements:
    - Fixed localization keys (removed custom section headers)
    - Fixed panel reset issue when selecting platforms
    - Much simpler GUI with only essential controls
    - Reduced code size by ~200 lines
  GUI Changes:

Version: 2.0.2
Date: 2025
  Major Changes:
    - Completely redesigned GUI system to use floating screen panel
    - Panel now uses player.gui.screen instead of relative anchoring
    - Automatic visibility control based on controller_type (Remote View detection)
    - Panel appears when entering Remote View, hidden in normal play
    - Manual positioning at x=220, y=100 for optimal placement
  Improvements:
    - Added gui.update_panel_visibility() function
    - Panel visibility updates every 30 ticks (~0.5 seconds)
    - Much more reliable GUI visibility in Remote View
  Technical:
    - Removed relative GUI anchor system (was conditional and unreliable)
    - Uses defines.controllers.remote for Remote View detection
    - Floating GUI with manual location control
