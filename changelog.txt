Version: 2.0.3
Date: 2025
  Major Changes:
    - Simplified to copy-only design (removed blueprint system entirely)
    - Quality now automatically inferred from source platform
    - Starter pack type inferred from source platform
  Improvements:
    - Fixed localization keys (removed custom section headers)
    - Fixed panel reset issue when selecting platforms
    - Much simpler GUI with only essential controls
    - Reduced code size by ~200 lines
    - Auto-activation: Platforms automatically unpause when construction completes
  GUI Changes:
    - Removed blueprint selector
    - Removed starter pack dropdown
    - Removed quality dropdown
    - Panel no longer resets when changing platform selection
  Technical:
    - Uses source_platform.starter_pack directly for quality inference
    - Removed force_data storage (no more blueprint tracking)
    - Added gui.update_status() for efficient status updates
    - Simplified player_data structure
  Bugfixes (2.0.3.1):
    - Fixed field name inconsistency (needs_blueprint vs needs_copy)
    - Fixed race condition where blueprint application would fail if surface/hub not ready
    - Added periodic retry mechanism (every 60 ticks) for pending platforms
    - Added comprehensive debug logging for blueprint application
    - Added error handling for import_stack() return values
    - Added force validation in periodic check
    - Fixed tile copying: changed always_include_tiles from false to true for contiguous ground
  Features (2.0.3.2):
    - Auto-activation: Platforms pause after blueprint application, then automatically unpause when construction completes
    - Smart timeout: Platforms activate after 5 minutes of no construction progress (handles unreachable ghosts)
    - Progress tracking: Monitors ghost entity count every 2 seconds to detect construction completion or stalls
    - Schedules preserved: Blueprint system automatically copies platform schedules (no manual intervention needed)
  GUI Improvements (2.0.3.3):
    - Enable Auto-Creation moved to top with bold text and colored indicator (green checkmark/red X)
    - Toggle button and panel now auto-hide when exiting remote view
    - Panel auto-closes when leaving remote view, remembers preference when returning
    - Fixed close/reopen bug where panel would auto-reopen after manual close
    - Shortened planet dropdown width to 150px
    - Added bottom description: "Completed platforms will be set on automatic."
    - Panel starts closed on save load, respects user preference
  Bugfixes (2.0.3.3):
    - CRITICAL: Fixed crash caused by invalid style "heading_1_label" (changed to "bold_label")
  GUI Improvements (2.0.3.4):
    - Changed disabled indicator from close_fat to not_available (much more visible red X)
    - Added "Enable Debug Logging" checkbox to panel for user-controlled debug output
    - All 12 debug print statements now conditional on debug_logging flag
    - Updated mod settings description with explicit min/max range (60-3600 ticks / 1-60 seconds)
  Technical (2.0.3.4):
    - Added debug_logging flag to player_data (defaults to false)
    - Debug messages only show when explicitly enabled by user
    - Prevents console spam during normal operation
  Settings (2.0.3.4):
    - Lowered check interval minimum from 60 to 1 tick (allows ultra-responsive automation)
    - Added strong performance warning for values below 60 ticks
    - Updated range display: 1-3600 ticks (0.017-60 seconds)

Version: 2.0.2
Date: 2025
  Major Changes:
    - Completely redesigned GUI system to use floating screen panel
    - Panel now uses player.gui.screen instead of relative anchoring
    - Automatic visibility control based on controller_type (Remote View detection)
    - Panel appears when entering Remote View, hidden in normal play
    - Manual positioning at x=220, y=100 for optimal placement
  Improvements:
    - Added gui.update_panel_visibility() function
    - Panel visibility updates every 30 ticks (~0.5 seconds)
    - Much more reliable GUI visibility in Remote View
  Technical:
    - Removed relative GUI anchor system (was conditional and unreliable)
    - Uses defines.controllers.remote for Remote View detection
    - Floating GUI with manual location control

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.1
Date: 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Attempted fix for GUI visibility (changed to relative GUI with anchor)
    - This version did not work correctly - see 2.0.2 for proper fix
